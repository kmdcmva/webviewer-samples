# WebViewer - Angular sample

[WebViewer](https://docs.apryse.com/web/guides/get-started) is a powerful JavaScript-based PDF Library that is part of the [Apryse SDK](https://apryse.com/). It provides a slick out-of-the-box responsive UI that enables you to view, annotate and manipulate PDFs and other document types inside any web project.

This sample is designed to show you how to Integrate WebViewer into an Angular project. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 21.2.0. [Read more about integrating with Angular](https://docs.apryse.com/web/guides/get-started/angular)

You can [watch a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxNjs4dc6zY) that walks you through how to embed Apryse's WebViewer inside of Angular project.

## Get your trial key

A license key is required to run WebViewer. You can obtain a trial key in our [get started guides](https://docs.apryse.com/web/guides/get-started), or by signing-up on our [developer portal](https://dev.apryse.com/).

## Initial setup

Before you begin, make sure your development environment includes [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

In order to set the license key, you will need to set the string in the WebViewer sample. One such way is by passing it into the constructor of the WebViewer: https://docs.apryse.com/documentation/web/faq/add-license/#passing-into-constructor

Follow the steps below to set the license key in this sample:

- Locate the app.component.ts file at ./src/app/app.component.ts
- Replace "your_license_key" with your license
- Save the file

## Install

```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ApryseSDK/webviewer-samples.git
cd webviewer-samples/webviewer-angular
npm install
```

## Run

```
npm start
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
